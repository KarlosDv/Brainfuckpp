# Brainfuckpp
Brainfuck Transpiled Programming Language meant to imitate somewhat Kotlin style syntax with scripting specifically tailored for development in Brainfuck, alongside an interlanguage designed for easy brainfuck scripting in a common almost algebraic expression format.

Example Hello World Program
```
#includes libs/system.js

proc _main {
    printRaw("Hello World!")
    uncall(ProcLoop)
}
```
